// Map Setup API

//

// These are native functions for describing the map configuration

// these funcs should only be used in the "config" function of

// a map script. The functions should also be called in this order

// ( i.e. call SetPlayers before SetPlayerColor...

/**
Sets the map name.

@note This function shall only be used within the scope of function `config`
in war3map.j, it is executed by the game when you load the lobby/selected
the map for preview.

@note v1.32.10: WorldEditor limits map name input to 36 characters (ASCII/Unicode)

@note
Old game versions (tested v1.0) used different sources for map name based on
where it was intended to be displayed:

- In map selection (to create a lobby), the map name embedded in HM3W map's header
was used (see legacy .w3m/.w3x file format).
- The map preview (right-hand side) runs the map's `config` code and thus
makes use of `SetMapName` and strings in .wts files.
- (Unused) Map name field in war3map.w3i

Reforged runs the configuration code in both cases. Therefore it always uses
the proper name at the expense of increasing the loading time of map selection list.

@note Supports color codes (they also affect sorting)

@note Map name length:

- Classic (1.0): Limited by total text width, e.g. `DescriptionFirstL...`
- Reforged (1.32.10): Up to two lines, then limited by text width, e.g. `VeryLongMapName-ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP...`

Sets the map description.

@note This function shall only be used within the scope of function `config`
in war3map.j, it is executed by the game when you load the lobby/selected
the map for preview.

@note The map description is saved to "war3map.w3i" too, but this field is unused.

@note Supports color codes

@note Length limits:

- Classic (1.0): Limited by total text width,
approx. 40 latin characters per line. Automatic line breaks.
- Reforged: Seemingly no limit, the description box gets (bugged)
vertical & horizontal scroll bars along with automatic line-breaking.

@note Line limits:

- Classic (1.0): Maximum 9 lines.
- Reforged (1.32.10): Seemingly no limit.
