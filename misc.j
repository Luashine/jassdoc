Adds a string to the preload buffer.

@param filename The string to be added to the buffer.
Should probably not be named `filename`.

@note The data will be put into the file like this:

So to put any executable code in the file you have to close the string and then
put your code onto a new line, like this:

    call Preload("\") \n call your_stuff_here()")

/**
Executes the preload-file.

@param filename The file to execute.

@note This only works if you have enable the usage of local files in your registry.
The registry key is `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Blizzard Entertainment\\Warcraft III\\Allow Local Files\`

@note Here are some ways to get the data out of the preload file into your map:
To store multiple integers you can use `SetPlayerTechMaxAllowed` to have a good
2d-array. Read via `GetPlayerTechMaxAllowed`.

For strings `SetPlayerName` is suited. To read use `GetPlayerName`.

Inside the preload script you can also use `ExecuteFunc` to call your map-defined
functions and interleave the preload script with your functions.

@note If you use `Preloader` to load some values into your map, these values
are very likely to be different for each player (since the player might not 
even have local files enabled), so treat them as async values.

@note Also see the documentation of `Preload` to see how to properly get the data
into the preload script.
