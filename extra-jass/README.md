# Extra Jass Files

More Jass script files to document the remaining bits in and around the game.

- reforged-hidden.j: functions that technically exist, but were not published for use through "common.j"
- reforged-dzapi.j: functions that are registered in Blizzard's worldwide Reforged, but probably just placeholders
- removed.j: removed functions and those with changed function signatures
