// Timer API

native CreateTimer          takes nothing returns timer

/**
@bug Destroying does not pause timer,
so if call of its callback is scheduled,
then callback is called with `GetElapsedTimer` being `null`.
*/
native DestroyTimer         takes timer whichTimer returns nothing

/**
Starts a previously created timer that calls a function when timeout reaches 0.

It is affected by gamespeed at any point of it execution, if the gamespeed is changed at 50% of timeout duration, the rest of the timeout will be correctly affected by new gamespeed.

@param whichTimer Handle to timer
@param timeout Delay in seconds
@param periodic
True: repeat timer after expiration (loop).
False: timer only runs once.

@param handlerFunc Callback function to be executed when timer expires.

@note See: `GetExpiredTimer` to retrieve the handle of the expired timer inside handlerFunc.

@note The table below shows how often a 0 millisecond timer is executed
in comparison with `TriggerRegisterTimerEvent`
(aka `TriggerRegisterTimerEventPeriodic`).
