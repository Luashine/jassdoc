/**
Set the damage amount of a damage event.

In 1.31 PTR there’s currently 3 new damage events:
1. `EVENT_UNIT_DAMAGED` - old classic event for a specific unit;
2. `EVENT_PLAYER_UNIT_DAMAGED` - Same as 1, but for all units of a specific player on the map;
   `// This seems to work fine anyway:`
   `call TriggerRegisterAnyUnitEventBJ(gg_trg_a, EVENT_PLAYER_UNIT_DAMAGING)`
3. `EVENT_UNIT_DAMAGING` - triggers before any armor, armor type and other resistances. Event for a specific unit like 1;
4. `EVENT_PLAYER_UNIT_DAMAGING` - triggers before any armor, armor type and other resistances. Useful to modify either damage amount, attack type or damage type before any reductions done by game.

1 and 2 - modify the damage after any reduction.
3 and 4 - changes damage before reduction. Amount you set will be reduced later according to target’s resistance, armor etc.

If set to <=0 during 3 or 4, then 1 or 2 will never fire.
Misses don’t trigger any damage events.
Set to 0.00 to completely block the damage.
Set to negative value to heal the target instead of damaging

@note Tip: calling `GetEventDamage` after you set it with this function will return the value you set.
@note If you’ll call `UnitDamageTarget` from within a trigger, which reacts to a damage event or triggered by one, it will cause infinite loop and game will crash, so you should handle such scenarios with additional logic.
