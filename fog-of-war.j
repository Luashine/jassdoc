/**
Creates an object that overrides the fog in a rect for a specific player.

A fog modifier is disabled by default, use `FogModifierStart` to enable.

This creates a new object with a handle and must be removed to avoid leaks: `DestroyFogModifier`.

@param whichState
Determines what type of fog the area is being modified to. See `fogstate` for type explanation.

@param where The rect where the fog is

@param useSharedVision
Apply modifier to target's allied players with shared vision?

@param afterUnits
Will determine whether or not units in that area will be masked by the fog. If it is set to true and the fogstate is masked, it will hide all the units in the fog modifier's radius and mask the area. If set to false, it will only mask the areas that are not visible to the units.

@bug (v1.32.10) Just by creating a modifier of type `FOG_OF_WAR_FOGGED` or
`FOG_OF_WAR_VISIBLE`, this will modify the player's global fog state before it is
enabled. "VISIBLE" will instantly become "FOGGED" and "FOGGED" will cause unexplored
areas to become explored. You can workaround this by using e.g. `SetFogStateRect`
after fog modifier creation.
